Dr. Vellek wasn’t human. Everyone knew it; nobody could prove it. Marine-biology department, six-foot-eight, always in immaculate black suits that strained over shoulders too broad, eyes the color of deep-ocean trenches.

I stayed late to finish a lab practical. The building was empty, lights dimmed to half power. I felt the air pressure drop first, like before a storm.

Then the tentacles came out of his sleeves.

Slick, midnight-blue, thicker than my forearm, ringed with soft suckers that kissed my skin like hungry mouths. One snapped my wrists above my head to the metal table. Another ripped my jeans open like tissue paper.

I should have screamed. Instead I whimpered, “Please…”

The thickest one coiled around my thigh, spreading me obscenely wide. A smaller one slithered under my hoodie, latched onto my nipple, and sucked so hard my vision whited out.

“You’ve been teasing me all semester,” he rumbled, voice layered, wrong. “Walking in here dripping for a real mating.”

A bulbous head the size of a fist pressed against my entrance. I was embarrassingly wet. It pushed in slow, spreading me open inch by agonizing inch, suckers pulsing inside my walls. Another tentacle shoved between my lips, filling my mouth with salty-sweet fluid that made my clit throb in time with my heartbeat.

He fucked me like a piston, table screeching across the floor. Every time he bottomed out something round and gelatinous slid from a slit in the tip and lodged deep, one egg after another, until my belly bulged like I was six months pregnant.

I came so hard I blacked out for a second. When I came to, he was still going, stuffing me fuller, whispering in a language that made my womb cramp with need.

By the time he finished I looked nine months gone, skin stretched tight and shiny, eggs shifting under the surface. He zipped himself away; suit immaculate again; and patted my distended stomach like a proud father.

“Carry them well, Miss Reed. I expect perfect attendance until they hatch.”

I waddled to every lecture after that, hoodie barely hiding the swell, dripping on my seat while he lectured about cephalopod reproduction with my belly visibly rippling in the front row.

Best. Grade. Ever.
